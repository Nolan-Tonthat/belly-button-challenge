# belly-button-challenge
UCB Week 14 Challenge

## Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
Complete the following steps:

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.
